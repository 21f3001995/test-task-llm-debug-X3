# Sales Total Calculator

## Brief
This project is a single-page HTML application that reads a CSV file containing sales data, computes the total sales, and displays the result in a designated HTML element. The application utilizes Bootstrap 5 for styling and provides console logs for debugging purposes.

### Features
1. Reads `sales.csv` and computes total sales.
2. Displays total in element `#total-sales`.
3. Includes console logs for parsed CSV, numeric values, and computed sum.
4. Loads Bootstrap 5 via jsDelivr.

## Deployment
To deploy this application, simply open the `index.html` file in a web browser. Ensure that the `sales.csv` file is in the same directory as the HTML file for proper functionality.
